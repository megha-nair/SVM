## Heart Disease Prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This repository contains Python code for predicting heart disease using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. It involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, prediction, and data visualization using Seaborn.

### Dataset
- The dataset used is named 'Heart_Disease_Prediction.csv'.
- It contains various features related to heart health, with the target variable being 'Heart Disease'.

### Usage
1. **Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the required libraries like numpy, pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn.
2. **Running the Code**: Execute the provided script in your preferred Python environment.
3. **Understanding the Code**: Comments are provided within the script for better understanding of each step.
4. **Visualizing Data**: The pair plot generated using Seaborn helps visualize feature relationships.

### Steps Involved
1. **Data Loading**: Read the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Handling Missing Values**: Check for and handle missing values if any.
3. **Encoding Target Variable**: Encode the target variable 'Heart Disease' for classification.
4. **Data Splitting**: Split the dataset into features (x) and target variable (y), and further split them into training and testing sets.
5. **Model Training**: Train the SVM classifier with a linear kernel using training data.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's accuracy on the test data.
7. **Making Predictions**: Predict heart disease for a sample input using the trained SVM model.
8. **Data Visualization**: Visualize relationships between features using Seaborn's pair plot.
